Bugs:

-Lag start (occurs on install)
	(When the lag start occurs everything appears as if it were running the whole time) (Rare)

-Last two files either not sent or sent over corrupted
(Solved) Sensor file might've kept growing after file size was determined making false size and
			causing errors when send and reading. Now stopped the sensors a bit earlier, didn't work
			Closed file right after turning off the sensor's, didn't work
			Same issue as above with scrambled data

-Sometimes on reinstall or random crash on watch app when connected, broken pipe occurs.
(Solved) Restart bluetooth service on Peng's app to clear the pipes, will probably fix it

-Bluetooth frequently doesn't connect until restart, could be issue with watch side
-receiver bluetooth thinks it's connected but watch isn't actually connected
(When connection is lost and retried it breaks, this is the main issue)
(Solved) Believe that when I stopped connecting phone to watch and watch to phone only it works, didn't work
			Ruining an already connected device by trying to reconnect could mess everything up, didn't work
			attempted to reconnect in a different manner after the first connect failed, test more
